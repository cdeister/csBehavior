Example Features and Other Capabilities:
State based behavior control.
Runs reliably at 1 KHz.
Visual stimuli and camera tracking via an optional raspberry pi.
Multi-color optical stimulus control.
Event-driven clocking of analog outputs (tying optical stimulus to galvo turnarounds).
Electronic record keeping via mqtt and google sheets.
